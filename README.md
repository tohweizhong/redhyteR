# redhyteR

A hypothesis mining package in R (WIP)

To install from github, run the following in R:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("tohweizhong/redhyteR")
```

The current iteration is to support only hypotheses with 2 subpopulations, e.g. control and non-control groups.

Project is decommissioned due to time commitment to work proper. Perhaps I can pick this up again in the near future.
